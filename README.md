## [Project 1: Wealth and Health of Countries (2015) Using Choropleth Maps](https://github.com/kellyngsf/choropleth_maps)
This is a project to learn how to plot choropleth maps and observe the wealth and health of countries all over the world. The data I will be using here is the GDP per capita and wealth of countries in 2015. I will plot this data on a world map with two plots with varying colors to see if there are any relationships between the wealth and health of countries or continents in 2015. Then, I will analyse the findings of the choropleth map plot and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this type of choropleth map plot.

## [Project 2: Preston Curve (Bubble Charts)](https://github.com/kellyngsf/preston_curve)
Following the 'Wealth and Health of Countries (2015) Using Choropleth Maps' project, this is a follow-up project to plot the same data through a different visualization. A problem with the wealth choropleth map and health choropleth map was the difficulty for readers to shift their attention between the two maps to observe a relationship between the two variables. Hence, in this project, I used a preston curve (bubble chart) to plot life expectancy and GDP per capita on the y and x axis, respectively. This plot will aim to better represent the relationship between these two variables and emphasize which countries are on the higher or lower scale on wealth and health in 2015.

## [Project 3: Networks](https://github.com/kellyngsf/euemail_networks.git)
The purpose of this project is to learn how to plot networks. More importantly, learning how to deal with large networks which may be problematic for network visualisation. In this project, I will use a data set from the paper 'Local Higher-order Graph Clustering', Yin et al. (2017), which is an anonymised email data set from a large European research institution. The data set contains directed edges in the network when one person sents at least one email to another. Furthermore, the emails only represent communication within the institution. The network plot produced resulted in a plot that was unreadable and one that you could not get any information from, therefore, I condensed the data into a more informative plot using a dendrogram.

## [Project 4: Singapore Population Pyramid](https://github.com/kellyngsf/sg_population_pyramid.git)
This project aims to investigate the changes of Singapore's population over the years, from 1960 to 2020. We do this through a visualization of their population data in a population pyramid in R. A population pyramis is a good way to represent population data because it enables a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of the population in various age groups, which will be shown through the shape of the pyramid. It was found that from 1960 to 2020, the most notable changes have been an increase in the older population and a slight decrease in the younger population. In this project, the genders were also plotted separately, therefore, it's observed that women tend to live longer than men.
