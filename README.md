## [Project 1: Wealth and Health of Countries (2015) Using Choropleth Maps](https://github.com/kellyngsf/choropleth_maps)
This is a project to learn how to plot choropleth maps and observe the wealth and health of countries all over the world. The data I will be using here is the GDP per capita and wealth of countries in 2015. I will plot this data on a world map with two plots with varying colors to see if there are any relationships between the wealth and health of countries or continents in 2015. Then, I will analyse the findings of the choropleth map plot and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this type of choropleth map plot.
