## [Project 1: Wealth and Health of Countries (2015) Using Choropleth Maps](https://github.com/kellyngsf/choropleth_maps)
This is a project to learn how to plot choropleth maps and observe the wealth and health of countries all over the world. The data I will be using here is the GDP per capita and wealth of countries in 2015. I will plot this data on a world map with two plots with varying colors to see if there are any relationships between the wealth and health of countries or continents in 2015. Then, I will analyse the findings of the choropleth map plot and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of this type of choropleth map plot.

## [Project 2: Preston Curve (Bubble Charts)](https://github.com/kellyngsf/preston_curve)
Following the 'Wealth and Health of Countries (2015) Using Choropleth Maps' project, this is a follow-up project to plot the same data through a different visualization. A problem with the wealth choropleth map and health choropleth map was the difficulty for readers to shift their attention between the two maps to observe a relationship between the two variables. Hence, in this project, I used a preston curve (bubble chart) to plot life expectancy and GDP per capita on the y and x axis, respectively. This plot will aim to better represent the relationship between these two variables and emphasize which countries are on the higher or lower scale on wealth and health in 2015.
